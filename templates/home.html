                    <h1>Welcome to Smart Inventory Management (SIM)</h1>
                    <p> SIM is a web application designed primarily for Humanitarian Organizations to increase efficiency and accuracy of Asset and Stock Management.
                    Current version only includes asset management module and stock management is under development.</p>
                    <p>The application is open source and free to use. The source files can be found <a href="https://github.com/alidusunen/SIMproduction"> here.</a> If you
                    have any questions regarding the code feel free to contact via github with the developer.</p>
                    <h3>Framework and APIs</h3>
                    <p> SIM uses powerful Django Python Framework as the main build component. Datatables jQuery plug-in is used for table views and Bootstrap 4
                     and Semantic UI are used as main design elements. In short a variety of programing languages are used to make this happpen.</p>
                    <p>Postgres Database are used in this production sample. Application is running on a free Heroku server as it can be told from the URL</p>
                    <p>Additional information in detail can be found under the relavent section for devolopers.</p>

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>If you are already working in humanitarian logistics you will find the terminology used in the application quite familiar.
                    Like all organizations have their differences in their process, SIM is based on a fusion of "best practices" in inventory management
                        and might be a bit different than what you are already using. </p>
                    <p>There are 6 main sections for Asset management. Brief explanation of each can be found below:</p>
                    <h4>Assets:</h4>
                    <p>As you can imagine from the name, it is the main function where you can view, create, assign
                        and update assets recorded in your database</p>
                    <h4>Users:</h4>
                    <p>Here you can view, create, assign
                        and update users(employees) of your organization. This "user" class is seperate from users of the application and is
                    reffered as "custodian" in the code to avoid overlaps with django user class.</p>
                    <h4>Reports:</h4>
                    <p>Under this section you can select a user or an asset to generate a report. In user reports,
                    you will find the all the assets assigned to this user in a chronological order with dates. In asset reports you will find
                    in chronological order users of this asset and the date of assignment</p>
                    <p> Important!!: Report entries are automatically generated when and asset issuance is made. These records can only be accessed
                    modified and deleted through admin panel which will be explained in detail later.</p>
                    <h4>Allocations:</h4>
                    <p> This is where end of grant allocations are done. Once an allocation is created, Donor and Budget line of the asset will
                    be automatically changed based on the allocation information entered on "create". </p><p> Allocations can be viewed in list and in detail
                    where list of allocated assets can be found in a table including the prior donor information. Also allocation information can be found in asset details as well</p>
                    <h4>Disposal:</h4>
                    <p>Under this section, you can select assets to dispose from the master database referring to a document number and mode of disposal. At the moment disposed assets still remain in the master database.
                        Based on ypur organizations policy python code can be modified:</p>
                        <p>- To remove the asset and save it to another database table called "disposed".</p>
                        <p>- To change the assets condition to disposed</p>
                    <h4>Categories:</h4>
                    <p> Here you can view and create categories and subcategories. Update and delete functions can only be done through admin panel(info below)</p>
                    <h3>Django Admin</h3>
                    <p> Django Admin panel is a User interface to manage database tables and models created under this application. As default it is not "user friendly"
                    but is a valuable tool to fix major issues that can occure in the database. Some functionalities are only accessible via admin database such as delete and
                    update of categories and subcategories.</p><p> Through admin panel, it is possible to import data from various file formats(excel, csv) as well as export</p>
                    <h3>Table Functionalities</h3>
                    <p>This application uses <a href="https://datatables.net/">"Datatable"</a> j-query Plug-In to visualize database tables in the most customizable way possible.</p>
                    <h4>Viewing Data:</h4>
                    <p>By default, tables are set to display 50 items per page. It can be reduced or increased based on your needs.</p>
                    <h4>Search Function:</h4>
                    <p>- You can search the all rows and colums from the search bar on the upper right corner.</p>
                    <p>- Each column has a searchbar where you can use it as "filter".</p>
                    <p>- Searches are done in realtime no need to hit any key.</p>
                    <p>- Searches will apply for the whole table, not only for visible items.</p>
                    <h4>Column Customization:</h4>
                    <p>- Column width can be resized based on your need.</p>
                    <p>- Columns order can be changed via drag the column title.</p>
                    <p>- In assets main view, columns can be hidden through a popup window that comes up onclick to Hide Column
                        button.</p>
                    <p>-"Column hide preferences" would be saved for 1 hour. Preferences will stay even if the page is refreshed.</p>
                    <p>- Above preferences will be reset onclick to "Reset Table" button.</p>
                    <h4>Excel Export:</h4>
                    <p>- You can export the view you filtered as an excel file.</p>
                    <p>- Hidden columns will not be reflected on the excel file.</p>
                    <h3> User Permissions </h3>
                    <p> The users mentioned here are not the custodians of the assests but the users of the application.
                        Currently there are 4 permission levels are defined for users and a user created for testing purposes for each. Additional users can be created via Django admin
                    panel and assigned to a group based on their responsibilities.</p>
                    <p>Password for all test user accounts are the same. test_123</p>
                    <h4>Logistics Coordinator</h4>
                    <p>test username: logco</p>
                    <p>-This group is a superuser meaning has full access to all functionalities and the admin panel.</p>
                    <p>-Log Co is the only group that can create allocations and disposals, delete assets. </p>
                    <h4>Logistics Manager</h4>
                    <p>test username: logmanager</p>
                    <p>-This group can create and update assets and users.</p>
                    <p>-It can delete users.</p>
                    <h4>Logistics Officer</h4>
                    <p>test username: logofficer</p>
                    <p>-This group can create and update assets and users.</p>
                    <h4>Logistics Assistant</h4>
                    <p>test username: logassistant</p>
                    <p>-This group can only view the pages and assign assets.</p>
                    <p>-Other functionalities are disabled.</p>
                    <h3>Notes for Devolopers</h3>
                    <p>To be updated....</p>
                    <p>Key points regarding the code will be explained here in detail. There will be a page added to github
                    for developers to explain the algorithms. For now here are a few key points:</p>
                    <p>Depreaciation: It is calculated in a function under "assets" model. Basically it calculates number of months passed until today
                    and deducts the monthly rate from the purchase value.</p>
                    <p>Each "section" is built as a separate django app.</p>
                    <p>Debugging option is left true for test purposes. There is no sensetive data involved so no security concerns at the moment.</p>
